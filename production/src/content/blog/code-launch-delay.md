DragonForgeCode is being delayed, as this launch is coming with a whole new website, we want time to test and make sure its the best we can get it, and as the origional plan for the new site was to launch on the first of september. we will be delaying the whole site until Halloween night, when DFC, DFG, and the new website as a whole will be launched on Halloween night!
