This list may gain or lose games throughout the year.

## Other

Gameplay: Each reviewed game will have 30-60 minutes of voiceless gameplay so you can see what the game is like.

DragonForgeGaming will still not get its own domain nor blog. DragonForgeGaming will have a content delivery network (CDN) to make it easier to embed images and/or videos into websites through other sources. Documentation on this will be released on DragonForgeCode's blog upon the release of DragonForgeGaming.

## Age considerations

Games have age ratings for a reason. Thus, DragonForgeGaming will have a system like on Steam. If one looks at an M-rated game's review, they will be prompted for their birth date[^2]. If a user is not within the age rating (17+), they will be blocked from viewing M-rated games. This will not apply to any rating below M. It is not a foolproof method of doing this, but without lots of complex systems and server-side data processing, it's the best system possible.

## DMCA considerations

Some game studios (especially Nintendo) have historically been harsh on content creators uploading videos on their games. DragonForgeGaming will be addressing this in two ways:

- Adding a warning on reviews of games by companies that have historically been strict.
- Not uploading gameplay footage for games by these companies[^3].

## Nerd stuff

Not everything is user-side; let's talk about the website.

DragonForgeCode will be using Starlight by Astro for the website. This will allow a nice, consistent layout and the ability to search for certain games, genres, age rating, etc!

To start, videos will be hosted on YouTube, and we do hope to switch to [Cloudflare Stream™](https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream)[^4]. Images will be hosted using [GitHub](https://github.com). The website will be hosted using [Cloudflare Pages™](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)[^4]. Exact information will be released later this year on DragonForgeCode.

## Release date

Finally, the release date. As there is a lot of gameplay footage that needs to be recorded, DragonForgeGaming will hopefully launch on Halloween night! This is so that we can get everything set up and hopefully have a better quality launch than DragonForgeNEXUS did.
