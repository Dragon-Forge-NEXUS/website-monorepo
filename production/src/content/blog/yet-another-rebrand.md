To start, I'm sorry for the amount of rebrands in the last few months, just in November of last year we rebranded to DragonForgeNEXUS from AltiesGamingStudios and now there is another rebrand.

## Introducing DrigonFusion

I would like to introduce (project) DrigonFusion! As of now DrigonFusion may or may not be the perminate name, We will have to wait and see.

## Plans

All plans are staying the same, except we will be rebranding and now launching on 9/01/2024 (september first)!

We will be merging with a project named "DrigonTech" that I (altie) have been working on, making one, set of sites.

### Sub-Sites

Here are all planned Sub-Sites:

- DragonForgeNEXUS (DFN) -> DrigonFusion (home)
- DragonForgeNews (DFNews) -> DrigonFusion News
- DragonForgeGaming (DFG) -> DrigonFusion Gaming
- DragonForgeCode (DFC) -> DrigonFusion Code
- DrigonStream -> DrigonFusion Watch
- DrigonTube -> DrigonFusion Watch

I will also be adding one of my own personal projects in as a sub-site, however I will keep my version up still:

- [YT-to-YTNoCookie](https://yt-to-ytnocookie.dovahkiin.xyz/) -> DrigonFusion Tools

## Closing

For the meantime, DragonForgeNEXUS' Nightly site will be going down as there is no need for it anymore.

I hope to see you on the other side, on DrigonFusion
