To start, these are just plans; they may still change.

## Changes to Current Plans
DragonForgeCode's plans have changed a bit.  
To start, DragonForgeCode will no longer have its own blog (for the moment). On release, DragonForgeCode will use this blog site under the category `Code`.  
Next, the launch NPM package will no longer be `DragonForgeCSS` but will be `SpaceDragon`. More about that in a little while.

## Launch Tutorials
On launch, DragonForgeCode will have the following tutorials:
* Languages:
  * HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
  * Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
  * JavaScript (JS)
  * Python
* Framework:
  * Astro
    * `create-astro`
    * `create-spacedragon`
* Other:
  * TailwindCSS

## SpaceDragon
DragonForgeCode's first major[^1], in-production NPM package is `create-spacedragon`! It is built on the code `create-t3-app` and has been edited for Astro! For more information, please go to [spacedragon.dovahkiin.xyz](https://spacedragon.dovahkiin.xyz).

## The Nerd Stuff... Wait, This Whole Thing Is Nerdy
DragonForgeCode has been using this stack for almost all of our websites:
* Astro
* TailwindCSS
* [Cloudflare Pages™](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)[^2]

It's very simple but gets the job done, and well! This stack is what DragonForgeCode's website will run on. Just add Astro Starlight, and you have the stack for DragonForgeCode's website—very simple but works well. We love using all of the aforementioned services and highly recommend them even though we are not affiliated with them.

This blog is currently the only thing not using Astro; it is still hosted on [Cloudflare Pages™](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)[^2], though.
