Welcome to DragonForgeNexus' first monthly blog post for March 2024, and the first blog post in about two months!

There are a load of changes to current plans, so they will be first!

## DragonForgeCode
DragonForgeCode will be undergoing significant changes. First, the DFC website has been pushed back to August 1, 2024.

### Tech Stack Change
You will see every site get updates over the next few months! We will be changing the tech stack from our current setup, Astro.js + CloudFlare Pages[^1], to REMIX + Vercel + other integrations. This change will make it easier for us to create dynamic sites. The first page to undergo this change will be this blog. After the main site switches, all sites will be on the dragonforgenexus.xyz domain and not subdomains. The only exception will be the DFC website as it will be in React Native. We still love Astro, but as of now, it is going to be a limiting factor for some planned projects.

## DragonForgeGaming
DragonForgeGaming will be sticking with the original plans as stated in the January 9, 2024, blog post "[DragonForgeGaming Release Info](/blog/gaming-release-info/)". We will be using the new tech stack for the site.

## Some Plans
**!!THESE PLANS MAY NOT HAPPEN THIS YEAR IF EVER!!**

This section is just to gauge people's thoughts on the ideas. Please use the comment section to give your input on any projects.

### DragonForgeProductions (DFP)
This is one of the plans I wanted to talk about today. DFP is a work-in-progress production studio. We are currently drafting the first production! All productions are planned to be either 2D or 3D animations. I hope to have more information for you soon!

### DragonForgeGameStudio (DFGS)
This is the second plan I wanted to talk about today. DFGS will be a game studio! We will be publishing our own games under the name DragonForgeGamePublishing (DFGP) and hope to someday have a game publisher that people and studios can publish under!
