## **What's Happening?**
So, I, Altie, have decided to dissociate the former `DragonForgeGaming` YouTube channel from NEXUS. I have a few reasons for this, which I'll get to later.

## **What's Happening to DragonForgeMedia?**
The channels (YouTube and Twitch) will be removed from the DragonForgeMedia website. DragonForgeMedia is not going anywhere; however, on the first of December, it will be put on a 'coming soon' page.

## **What's Happening with the Channel?**
It's not going anywhere. As you may or may not have seen, it has been renamed to `Altie122`, and I will continue to post on the channel.

## **Why the Separation?**
Here's a list of reasons:

1. **Pressure:** Posting on a channel while keeping up a website and a few other projects 😉, all connected, creates a lot of pressure. I would like to separate them.
  
2. **Content:** The name `DragonForgeGaming` locks it into gaming, but I would like to create more content, and I couldn't figure out a name for it.
  
3. **The Name:** The name `DragonForgeGaming` I shortly noticed was very close to another channel on the platform, `Dragon Forge Gaming`, a channel that has been dormant for 9 months. I had not noticed that until well after the rebrand.

## **Notes:**
I will post blog posts for the channel on this website under the category `Altie122`[^1].

The channel will continue to have notifications on all Discord servers under the `FYTS` channel.

The channel will also be in the `Fellow YouTuber and Twitch Streamers Program` (`FYTS`) and will be on the website.

That's it for today/tonight. Have a good day/night, and I will see you in the next post.
