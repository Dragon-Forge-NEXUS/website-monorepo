import Wsdbtn from "../../components/common/wsdbtn.astro";
import BlogTags from "../../components/blog/tags.astro";

<div class="bg-red-700 w-full text-center p-5 text-white text-2xl">
  This Blog post is out of date, please see [this
  blogpost](/blog/posts/v3-website). Styles will be wrong as we have moved away
  from daisyui.
</div>

To begin, this blog post will be different than normal. We will include buttons and working examples of each feature we talk about.

## Navigation

From the last site to this one, the navigation has undergone significant changes!

### The Pages Button

On the right side of the navigation bar, you will find this button:

<Wsdbtn />

This will open up the navigation drawer. Give it a try! Press the button right above this text to see it in action!

This drawer contains links to every home page, Discord servers, socials, and the most recent blog post.

### The NEXUS

You most likely arrived at the blog from The NEXUS, which serves as the landing page for the entire site.

### Blog

This section encompasses various navigation elements.

#### The Blog Landing

On the landing page of the blog, you will find a list of every blog post, ordered from the latest to the oldest.

On the Blog landing page, you will encounter this:

<BlogTags />

These are the blog tags or categories. Each blog post is assigned one or more tags.

#### The Blog Tags

I just covered the tags as they appear on the landing page. When you click on one of the tags, you will see all the blog posts categorized under that tag, from the latest to the oldest.

#### The Blog Page

You're currently on one! The navigation is almost the same as usual, with this additional button:

<a class="btn btn-ghost btn-circle avatar" href="/blog">
  <svg
    xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
    viewBox="0 0 512 512"
    class="w-5 rounded-full fill-current"
  >
    <path d="M48 256a208 208 0 1 1 416 0A208 208 0 1 1 48 256zm464 0A256 256 0 1 0 0 256a256 256 0 1 0 512 0zM217.4 376.9c4.2 4.5 10.1 7.1 16.3 7.1c12.3 0 22.3-10 22.3-22.3V304h96c17.7 0 32-14.3 32-32V240c0-17.7-14.3-32-32-32H256V150.3c0-12.3-10-22.3-22.3-22.3c-6.2 0-12.1 2.6-16.3 7.1L117.5 242.2c-3.5 3.8-5.5 8.7-5.5 13.8s2 10.1 5.5 13.8l99.9 107.1z" />
  </svg>
</a>

This button is located in the top left corner of the navigation bar and directs to /blog, making it easier to return to the blog landing page from a blog post.

### Page Navigation

We've discussed The NEXUS and the Blog navigation. Now, let's talk about page navigation. Currently, the partners page(s) are the only ones available, so that's the primary focus of navigation.

Here's what the page-to-page navigation looks like:

<div class="dropdown">
  <div tabindex="0" role="button" class="btn btn-ghost btn-circle">
    <svg
      xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
      class="h-5 w-5"
      fill="none"
      viewBox="0 0 24 24"
      stroke="currentColor"
    >
      <path
        stroke-linecap="round"
        stroke-linejoin="round"
        stroke-width="2"
        d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h7"
      />
    </svg>
  </div>
  <ul
    tabindex="0"
    class="menu menu-sm dropdown-content mt-3 z-[1] p-2 shadow bg-base-100 rounded-box w-52"
  >
    <li>
      <a href="/partners/fyts">FYTS</a>
    </li>
    {/* <li><a>Portfolio</a></li>
    <li><a>About</a></li> */}
  </ul>
</div>

This navigation menu is positioned on the left side of the navigation bar.

## What's Coming, What's Going?

### Leaving

- blog.dragonforgenexus.xyz
  - This is the new blog. We will be redirecting the domain to this blog.
- Media Page (Temp)
  - We currently don't have anything to put on the page, so for the moment, DFM is going away.

### Coming

- code.dragonforgenexus.xyz (launching 4/11/2024)
  - DragonForgeCode is launching very soon! You can visit the current site <a href="https://code.dragonforgenexus.xyz" class="after:content-['_↗']">here</a>.

Gaming will still be launching around October, but for now, that's it. Have a good day/night!

Head Dragon, DragonForgeNEXUS
