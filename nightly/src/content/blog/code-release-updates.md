To start, these are still just plans; they may still change.

## Launch Tutorials
This section has been updated with the official (guaranteed) launch tutorials.

On launch, DragonForgeCode will offer the following tutorials:
* Languages:
  * HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
  * Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
  * JavaScript (JS)

DragonForgeCode will also provide complete references for each.

## The Nerd Stuff... Wait, This Whole Thing Is Nerdy
Tech stack changes will be elaborated on in the blog post from the first of the month ([March 2024 Monthly Post](https://blog.dragonforgenexus.xyz/blog/march-2024-monthly-post/)).

### DragonForgeNEXUS:
DragonForgeNEXUS will be transitioning to the following stack (back to):
* [ASTRO](https://astro.build)
* [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [daisyui](https://daisyui.com/)

### DragonForgeCode:
DragonForgeCode, the website still in alpha, will be developed using:
* [REMIX](https://remix.run)
* [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [daisyui](https://daisyui.com/)

Check out the alpha preview [here](https://code.dragonforgenexus.xyz) (currently there are no tutorials [unless you type in '/html' ;D]).


### DragonForgeGaming:
DragonForgeGaming will be integrated into the main code base.

### Blog:
DragonForgeNEXUS's blog will be merged into the main code base.

### Hosting
We are transitioning hosts from Cloudflare[^1] to Vercel. All pages will continue to use Cloudflare[^1] for DNS and DDOS protection, but Vercel will serve as the primary host for the sites.

## Sad News
We are considering branching off from DragonForgeNEXUS towards the end of the year. This plan is still in its infancy and may not come to fruition; further details will follow.
