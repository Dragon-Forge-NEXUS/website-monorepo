Welcome to DragonForgeCode!

## But to Start, the Nerdy Stuff... Wait, This Whole Thing Is Nerdy

The tech stack has changed again, and for the final time:

### DragonForgeNEXUS:

The following tech stack is now what every page runs on:

- [AstroJS](https://astro.build)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [React](https://react.dev)
- [HeadlessUI](https://headlessui.com)
- [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es) (Blog comments [try it below!])
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) (Hosting)

## Finally...

DragonForgeCode has arrived!

Although changes will be made, here is what you can see right now!

Tutorials:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

We do not have references or cheat sheets quite yet, but you can expect them in the weeks to come!

DragonForgeCode will have its own PWA (progressive web app); however, using the DragonForgeNEXUS PWA will also get you into it! We plan to launch apps, but as of now, that is not feasible as it would involve rewriting the site in React Native (we plan to use Expo for the app).

As of now, DragonForgeCode does not have a Dark and Light mode like the rest of the website. We do plan to add a light and dark mode in the coming weeks.

We are working on also getting [code pens](https://codepen.io) and/or StackBlitz for you to be able to mess with the code we are showing in the browser, but for now, we are not offering it.

### Working on More

We plan to release these tutorials in the upcoming weeks:

- TypeScript
- Astro
- Python
- Markdown
- MDX

We will also be working on getting references and cheat sheets for each as soon as possible.

For now, that's it! If you want to go mess around, click [here](/code), and I hope you have a good day/night!
