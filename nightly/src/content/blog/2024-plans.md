To start, this will mainly be plans and a small roadmap of 2024, and this may end up being long—sorry.

## DragonForgeGaming
This is not about the YouTube channel, as explained in a past post, but the site.

DragonForgeGaming will hopefully launch around October of this year!

This launch will include:
1. Game Reviews
2. Gameplay[^1]
3. Gaming News

Game reviews will include, but are not limited to:
- The Elder Scrolls V, Skyrim (2011, 2016, 2021)
- Call of Duty Modern Warfare III (2023)
- Minecraft (2009)
- Call of Duty Warzone (2020)
- Roblox (2006)
- Fallout 4 (2015)
- Fallout 3 (2009)
- Fortnite (2017)
- And way more!

A full list will be released later this week or early next week in a blog post!

DragonForgeGaming, for the moment, will NOT have its own domain. It will work on the subdomain `https://gaming.dragnforgenexus.xyz/`. This subdomain will not be used until release but will redirect to the main website.

More updates coming soon!

## DragonForgeCode
DragonForgeCode will be launching in the next few months. Day one it will have a blog (separate from this one), 3 programming languages, 1-2 Web Frameworks, and some more! It will be released either February 1st, February 20th, March 11th, or April 1st (no jokes there :D). This may change; we want it to be as good as possible for the launch. We will be getting it its own domain.

DragonForgeCode will also release with a CSS framework built on Tailwindcss! "`DragonForgeCSS`," as we will be calling it, may be delayed as it takes a lot of time to do this.

DragonForgeCode will NOT be launching with apps but will have something called PWA (Progressive web app). You can try it out on this blog! Just look at the URL bar for a button that says something like (this is on Edge but should be close) "`App available. Install DragonForgeNEXUS' Blog`" or on iOS "`Add app to home screen`". DragonForgeCode is working to roll this out to all DragonForgeNEXUS websites.

## New Projects
DragonForgeNEXUS is gaining 2 new projects. Both are early on but may launch, even just a website this year!

### DragonForgeMedia Productions
DragonForgeMedia Productions is an animation and digital art studio. The first project is currently in planning and will not be announced as of this moment, but it will be exciting to see where it goes!

### DragonForgeGameStudios
DragonForgeGameStudios is, well, a game studio! The first project is going to be in, and based on the events in DragonForgeMedia Productions' first project! We are working on a small game in the meantime!

Both new projects will get blog categories on this blog for the moment!
