## Choosing an editor

Any code editor works with HTML, you can (in theory) even use MS word to code!

here are some good free options:

- Visual Studio Code (MS)
  - it is free, open source, has a ton of great QoF features, and thousands of usefull extentions
  - you can download VSCode [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or use it in the browser [here](http://vscode.dev)
- Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac)
  - preinstalled in all OS installs, and works just fine
- Nano (Unix/Linux/Mac)
  - preinstalled in most OS's, cammand line based (more advanced)

There are thousands more, but for us, we will be using Visual Studio Code (aka. VSCode or VSC)

## Starting off

To start, make sure your editor of choice is installed

### Using the VScode app:

1. Open VSCode
2. then hit 'open folder' this will prompt you to open a folder. Choose a folder or right click and make a new folder to write your code in.

### Using the VSCode website:

This may not work on some browsers or devices

1. Open [vscode.dev](http://vscode.dev)
2. then hit 'open folder' this will prompt you to open a folder. Choose a folder or right click and make a new folder to write your code in.

## Make a new file

click file > new file to make a new file name the file "`index.htm`" (you can use htm or html, both work just as well, that is up to you)

## Write Some Code

Type or copy the following code into VSCode:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

you can view the file [here](https://vscode.dev/github/Dragon-Forge-NEXUS/website-monorepo/blob/main/code/public/examples/html/editor/index.html) or download it <a href="/examples/html/editors/index.html" download="index.html">here</a>.

## Open the file in your browser

Open the saved HTML file in your favorite browser (double click on the file, or right-click - and choose "Open with").

The result will look like this:  
(some setting in select browsers may force the background to be black and text to be white, this is normal in those browsers)
